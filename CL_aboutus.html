        <h2>Reading Steakhouse History</h2>
        <p>The Reading Steakhouse is home to the famous signature New York Strip. Recently opened in Reading, PA in 2019, our house offers a wide variety of choices seen from our menu. We offer flexibility in choices of sides and toppings. Other local food favorites the restaurant has to offer is the Double Decker Reading Burger, Grilled Shrimp, Caesar Salad, Ribeye, and many more.</p>
        <p>Originally founded in 2017, we at the Reading Steakhouse wanted to ensure that the atmosphere and menu suits all types of preferences people have.</p>
        <p>Not only are we focused on the menu, we are also focused on creating the perfect ambiance and atmosphere to allow people to relax and enjoy their food! One of our mottos is to always put out delicious dishes, and we can assure you that all ingredients used to do so are fresh. We get our meat fresh from the butcher daily and display all of our different types of meat out at the counter near the main lobbby of the restaurant.</p>
